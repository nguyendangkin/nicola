Txt_Bar_Message_Start_01
Welcome to Patty's Party Planning Place!
Txt_Bar_Message_Start_02
If you want to find new party members, this is the place to be! Same goes if you want to ditch them, for that matter.
Txt_Bar_Message_Top
So, how can I help you today?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_CannotDropOff
You want to drop someone off?<cf>Erm, sorry to break it to you, but you're all alone right now, {LEADER}.
Txt_Bar_Message_DropOffTop
So, who do you want to leave behind?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_DropOffHero
Uhh, I don't think so. If {HERO}'s hanging out here with me, who'll be out there telling you guys what to do?
Txt_Bar_Message_DropOffDeath_01
Hold on! You want me to take in {WORD} like that? What kind of place do you think I'm running here!?
Txt_Bar_Message_DropOffDeath_02
Oh, I get it. Too short on funds to pay for a resurrection, huh?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_DropOffAbnormalStatus
So you want to leave {WORD} here, right? Oof, <IfGender_WORD(he's,she's,they've)> definitely seen better days...
Txt_Bar_Message_ReplaceSelectDeath
Hmm... Well, this is frowned on in party-planning circles, but I'll take {WORD}'s coffin off your hands.
Txt_Bar_Message_ReplaceSelectDeathCancel
Well, in that case, show some respect and pony up already! The poor thing...
Txt_Bar_Message_ReplaceSelect
What shall we do about {WORD}, then?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_DropOff_01
So you want to leave {WORD} here, right?
Txt_Bar_Message_DropOff_02
Got it. Looks like you can have a rest for a while, {WORD}.
Txt_Bar_Message_Replace_01
So you want to swap {WORD} out, is that right?
Txt_Bar_Message_Replace_02
In that case, who's going to take their place?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_CannotReplace
You're kidding, right?<cf>You can't have a party made up of nothing but a bunch of coffins!
Txt_Bar_Message_PickUpSelect
So, who do you want to take along with you?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_CannotPickUp
Yikes! I'm afraid there isn't anyone available to join your party. Sorry!
Txt_Bar_Message_PickUp_01
You want {WORD} to join you?<cf>No problemo!
Txt_Bar_Message_PickUp_02
Yoo hooo! {WORD}!<cf>{LEADER}'s here to see you!
Txt_Bar_Message_PickUp_03
{WORD} joins the party!
Txt_Bar_Message_Sort
I'll put anything your friend isn't using in your bag there, okay?
Txt_Bar_Message_SortFirst
Otherwise, you might lose track of something important!
Txt_Bar_Message_DropOffAgain
Do you want to drop anyone else off?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_PickUpAgain
Can I fetch anyone else for you while you're here?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_CannotPickUpPartyMAX_01
But you've already got plenty of company there as it is!
Txt_Bar_Message_CannotPickUpPartyMAX_02
You'll have to leave someone behind if you want to add a new member to your party.
Txt_Bar_Message_CannotViewRoster
Yikes! I'm afraid I don't have any of your party members staying with me at the moment.
Txt_Bar_Message_ViewRosterTop
Come to reappraise your options, eh?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_TopAgain
Can I do anything else for you today?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_Finish
Then we're done! Call again soon!
Txt_Bar_Message_DropOffOnlyLend
Wait a second, if you leave them with me then your party'll be nothing but volunteers!
Txt_Bar_Message_LendFirst
If you're feeling kind, you can sign up your party members here to go lend someone else a helping hand.<KEY_WAIT><cf>Anyone you register with me will be able to join another entirely different adventure.<KEY_WAIT><cf>Now, that's not to say they'll up and vanish from your party or anything!<KEY_WAIT><cf>They'll just be available to help other adventurers out if they're down on their luck.
Txt_Bar_Message_LendNone
Hmm, doesn't look like you've got anyone to send off right now.
Txt_Bar_Message_LendTop
So, who were you thinking might be helper material?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_LendTop2
Anyone else you want to send off to help an adventurer in need?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_LendRegistration
{WORD}, huh? Fine choice.<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_LendReregistration
Oh, you want to sign up {WORD} again? Sure thing!<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_LendChange
Just so you know, you've got {WORD2} on volunteer duty right now. Are you okay with lil' ol' {WORD} taking their place?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_LendDecide
Alright! Then it's {WORD}'s turn to aid an adventurer in need.
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowFirst
In need of some help, are we? Well, you're in luck; I can let you borrow adventurers from other parties if they've signed up with me.
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowNone
Oh dear... No one's actually signed up yet. I'm sure things'll change soon!
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowTop
So, which one of these fine adventuring folk would you like to come lend you a hand?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowTop2
Well, who would you like to help you out then?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowReturnConfirm
Are you really okay with saying bye to {WORD}? You two look like the best of buddies to me.
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowReturnDecide
Alrighty. I'll move everything {WORD} had into your bag, then.
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowReturnNoLive
Wait, but {WORD}'s the only living person left in your party! You should probably hang on to <IfGender_WORD(him,her,them)> for now...
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowReturnCancel
Oh, not quite ready to say farewell to {WORD} yet? It's alright, I'm bad at goodbyes too.
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowSelect
So you want {WORD} to lend you a helping hand?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowDecide
Great choice! {WORD}'s all yours.
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowPartyAdd
Will you be taking {WORD} out with you right away?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowPartyChange
Hmm, looks like you've already got a full house to me. Do you want to ask one of your pals to take it easy here for a bit?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowPartySelect
Alrighty. Whose turn is it to take a load off, then?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowPartySelect2
Who else would you like to give a break then?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowPartyToBar
Okay, {WORD}! Time to take a load off. I'll put everything <IfGender_WORD(he hasn't,she hasn't,they haven't)> got equipped in your bag for you.
Txt_Bar_Message_BorrowAddBarMember
Don't worry, {WORD}'ll be right here whenever you want to pick <IfGender_WORD(him,her,them)> up again.
Txt_Bar_Message_Find
Feeling like your party's still short a few pals?<KEY_WAIT><cf>Well, you could always try talking to any adventurer that happens to be here, but your best bet is to head upstairs.<KEY_WAIT><cf>I promise my man up there will be able to find you the exact type of adventurer you're looking for, or my name isn't Patty!
Txt_Bar_Message_Help
Feeling like helping out another adventurer, or is it you that's in need of some aid?<NO_INPUT>
Txt_Bar_Message_HelpAgain
Anything else I can help you with?<NO_INPUT>
