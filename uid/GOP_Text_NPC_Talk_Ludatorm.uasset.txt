Text=*: Friend, is it true that thou didst defeat dread Zoma, Lord of the Underworld?

SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_020
Text=*: But whomsoever it may have been, surely this day they do smile down from the heavens. After all, who could not but rejoice at the light which batheth the land once more?
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
Text=*: Alefgard is a realm of darkness, sealed fast from all other worlds. A prison of misery wherein hope can never thrive.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_020

SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_020
Text=*: What say'st thou? The Lord of the Underworld was bested without even the hero's aid? 'Tis a miracle!
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_020
Text=*: But of course. Modesty becometh a hero. The great one needs must hide from sight until such time as the adulation subsideth.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_010
Text=*: The Lord of the Underworld dineth on despair, and quencheth his unslakable thirst with tears.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_010
Text=*: Doth he suffer we peoples of Alefgard to live only that we might serve to satisfy his vile appetites?

Text=*: In the very centre of the desert north of this place lieth an ancient ruin.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_010
Text=*: Deep within its walls there gapeth a great chasm without bottom.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_010
Text=*: If the legends speak true, 'twas created by the great rending of claws when the Lord of the Underworld was birthed into this realm.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_020
Text=*: ...What say'st thou? Thou gavest the Lord of the Underworld a drubbing? Zounds, thou art mighty indeed!

SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1010_010
Text=*: In all my years, I have not met but a single soul who set out to breach its defences and lived to tell the tale.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1010_010
Text=*: Heed mine advice: should thou wishest to live long, then do not even ponder heading there.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1010_020

SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: Not so very long ago, heroes by their hundreds did lay their heads in this, our humble hostelry.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: But alas, none returned from whence they came, and our rooms stand bare and empty... (sniff)
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020

Text=*: Our... Our hero and saviour walketh not beside thee... C-Can it be...? Is our hero...?
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=*: No! Alas and alack, no! So our saviour smote dread Zoma, but was lost to us in consequence? Such tragedy... Such loss...
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020

Text=My guard hath told me much of thy deeds. Forgive me for summoning thee here so suddenly, but there is something I would ask of thee.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Perchance thou art familiar with the name <6>Ortega<9>?
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Thou art indeed his child after all.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Then allow me to officially bid thee welcome to Tantegel.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Now, 'twould behove us to begin by explaining how we of Tantegel came to know thy father.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Hard to fathom though it may be, Ortega once resided within these very walls.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=It must have been, what, a decade or so ago. 'Twas a day like any other, when an injured warrior was carried into the castle.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=His wounds were most severe, but he was yet to breathe his last.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Alas, his own name excluded, his memories had taken their leave of him entirely.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=I elected to let him stay with us whilst he recovered. Ortega even served me for a time.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Though he remembered naught of his old life, he was a gentleman most jovial, and well liked by all in the castle.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Then, all too suddenly, one day he simply...vanished. Nary a soul knew whither he had gone.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Surely thou findest thyself here today in search of thy father. By all means, ask those within the castle anything thou wishest.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=I am certain thou shalt be reunited with him erelong. But know patience. Should tragedy befall thee in thy haste, Ortega too would suffer.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Prior to thine arrival, Tantegel was visited upon by a fellow of the name <6>Robbing Hood<9>, or somesuch.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=The fiend was caught in the act of committing a crime most heinous and is under lock and key in the church. One would hope he is presently repenting for his actions.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=Well met, {LEADER}.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=Mayhap thou art familiar with the town of Cantlin, which lieth to the south of Tantegel. As I recall, Ortega sought to repair there.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=I presume he was also aware of the peculiar shrine hard by. Shouldst thou investigate said shrine, a clue to Ortega's fate may present itself to thee.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Well met, {LEADER}.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=How goeth thy quest to find Ortega? I trust thou givest thyself leave to rest thy feet from time to time.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Heed me well, for repose is vital to soothe thy wounds and calm thy mind. My chancellor tells me the common folk oft visit the hot springs in Kol to the east for this very purpose.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Mayhap forgetting thy duties for a time will stir within thee ideas hitherto unconceived.

Text=Well met, {LEADER}.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=Hast thou laid eyes upon the lofty tower that riseth from an island to the distant north-east?
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text='Tis named the Tower of Rubiss, and<--->if legend is to be believed<--->is the holy abode of its namesake.

SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_060
Text=Well met, {LEADER}. Perchance that which I am about to tell thee hath reached thine ears already...
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_060
Text=There is an isle, far south-east of Tantegel, upon which standeth an ancient shrine.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_060
Text=A priest of a disposition most thorny resideth there in anticipation of the arrival of the chosen one.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_060
Text={HERO}, I am of the stout belief that he will reveal to thee the path thou must next tread on thy journey.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_060
Text=Though I know not wherefore this feeling has stirred within me, I place my full faith in it nevertheless.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_070
Text=Well met, {LEADER}.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_070
Text=Since last we met I have been concerning myself deeply with thoughts of Ortega's whereabouts.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_070
Text=Long have I wrangled inwardly upon this topic, before settling firmly on the notion that he travelled to the isle of the great fiend, where Zoma doth abide.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_070
Text='Tis not a place that may be reached by a mere mortal, yet <6>mere<9> befitteth not one of Ortega's stature...
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_070
Text=Time is of the essence, {HERO}. I bid thee find Ortega before it is too late.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_080
Text=Well met, {LEADER}. Thou art of a countenance most hale.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_080
Text='Tis a most vigorating sight amid the rising gloom that Zoma hath beckoned. I must send what troops I may spare to neighbouring settlements...

SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=The mighty Ortega fought alongside us against Zoma's legions in the past. I had never seen a warrior so capable, and I have not seen one since.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=That a hero should come forth with strength enough to vanquish the Lord of the Underworld...

Text=And one so young, at that...
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=And to have done so without the aid of others...
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=I would expect no less from mighty Ortega's heir. Thou shalt be exalted for ages to come!
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=Alas, that so fine a man as he should meet such an end... He shall be sorely missed, child.

SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=So warriors truly did exist capable of vanquishing the Lord of the Underworld...
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=But then, companions chosen by the great {HERO} <IfGender_HERO(himself,herself,)> cannot but be equal to such a task...
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=In any case, thou hast my heartfelt congratulations. Now, His Majesty awaiteth!
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_030

Text=*: 'Twas my duty, when he bode here with us, to attend to the brave hero Ortega.
SelfId=Txt_Talk_Ludatorm_Castle_2F_throne_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
